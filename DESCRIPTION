Title: Parallelized Genomic Prediction and GWAS
Version: 0.1

Description: Frequently used methods in genomic applications with emphasis on parallel computing (OpenMP).
 At its core, the package has a Gibbs Sampler that allows running univariate linear
 mixed models that have both, sparse and dense design matrices. The parallel sampling method
 in case of dense design matrices (e.g. Genotypes) allows running Ridge Regression or BayesA for
 a very large number of individuals. The Gibbs Sampler is capable of running Single Step Genomic Prediction models.
 In addition, the package offers parallelized functions for common tasks like genome-wide
 association studies and cross validation in a memory efficient way.
